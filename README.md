Repository for test codes - Beginning

I am Insanityplea and this is the beginning of a long journey to teach myself lua code to create World of Warcraft addons.
Specifically in the future I would like to work towards developing and completeing a Personalized User Interface that can be used 
by other players when World of Warcraft Classic launches.
